# COVID-19 DASHBOARD

I am a newbie in Data Analytics. I found Tableau to be a very handy tool for analysing and cleaning raw data in a very detailed manner.
So, I created my first dashboard on the most trending topic of the world right now, i.e. coronavirus

### You can have a look at the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/satyam.saran#!/vizhome/CovidData_16067225667820/Covid-19Dashboard)

The dashboard has its datasource as a google sheet which is updated daily according to the development of the pandemic.
It contains information on **total cases, total deaths, mortality rate, growth from last month, cases by country, daily case count,
deaths per country and a world map indicating the extent to which this pandemic has hit a particular nation in terms of total case count.**
The data can also be filtered on a range of dates as desired.

For Mortality rate, the formula is: `SUM(Deaths)/SUM(Cases)`

This repo contains the dataset used and the developed tableau workbook.
